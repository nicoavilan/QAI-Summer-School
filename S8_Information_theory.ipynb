        "This guide introduces undergraduate students to the core concepts of classical and quantum information theory, with a focus on their applications in quantum computing. It includes clear explanations, Python code examples optimized for Google Colab, and visualizations to enhance understanding while maintaining mathematical rigor. The guide covers foundational topics like entropy, mutual information, Shannon's theorems, and their quantum analogues (von Neumann entropy, quantum mutual information, Holevo's bound). Practical examples and exercises connect these concepts to quantum computing tasks such as quantum state compression, quantum communication protocols, and error correction."
